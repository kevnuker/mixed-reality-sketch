First successful voice command based version of the app.

Two voice commands that are enabled are "Move" and "Petite". 

"Petite" is the command used to rotate objects. It was used in place of "Rotate" command as it was easier for the HoloLens to recognize :).
"Move" command moves the object. No surprises there!
